# Shortcuts - Lombiq UI Testing Toolbox



Provides some useful shortcuts for common operations that UI tests might want to do or check, e.g. turning features on or off, or logging in users. This way, UI tests needn't use multi-step UI processes to do these operations (and thus implicitly be coupled with and tests those features).
 
For general details about and on using the Toolbox see the [root Readme](../Readme.md).

Note that the module depends on [Helpful Libraries](https://github.com/Lombiq/Helpful-Libraries).
